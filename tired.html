    <h1>tired</h1>
    <h2>(Struggling to Begin) (gpt version)</h2>
    <h2>I'm at a crossroads with Owehost and my other active projects. While I enjoy managing them, the mental and financial toll is becoming overwhelming. In the past years, I've incurred losses exceeding $3,000 USD with Owehost. This year, growth has been stagnant, and I'm uncertain if I can sustain it for more than another year.    </h2>
    <h2>Balancing school, work, and these projects is challenging. Owehost alone demands nearly 30 hours weekly, yet it's hemorrhaging close to $500 per month. Continuing at this rate means a potential annual loss of $6,000. It's disheartening to invest so much time without seeing tangible results.    </h2>
    <h2>As I pen this at 22:00, my thoughts are clouded – perhaps it's just late-night musings, but the dilemma is real. Running a business is an aspiration of mine, a career I genuinely want to pursue. However, the current situation – losing $500 monthly while juggling work and school – is unsustainable.    </h2>
    <h2>I'm open to suggestions. If you have ideas for navigating my company's future or other project propositions, I'd greatly appreciate your input. Please reach out to me at layered@owehost.com.
    <h1>tired (my version)</h1>
    <h2>(no idea how to start)</h2>
    <h2>i don't know what to do with Owehost and my other active projects, i like running them but its becoming both tiring mentally and tiring to my wallet. i've lost well over $3,000 USD over the last years of running Owehost. it's seen almost no growth this year but I don't know if I can keep it up and running for more than like another year, i'm busy with school and work and don't have time to work on a project that's loosing me close to $500/mo and to keep the company up and running like this for a year would cost me $6,000 in just ONE year. I spend around 30 hours a WEEK working on Owehost just for no real changes happening. I don't really know what I want to do and its late at the time that i'm writing this at 22:00 so idk if its just like thinking late but idk. running a business is hard and it's truely what i want to do for my main job but i have no way to work, do school and run Owehost if I'm loosing $500/month and spending 30 hours a week on it</h2>
    <h2>if anyone has ideas for what i should do with my company or ideas for other projects to do, please. email me at layered@owehost.com</h2>
